TaskBoard – Java web app on Azure IaaS

The service I am hosting is a simple Java JSP/Servlet web application called “TaskBoard”. It is a small task-tracking web app that allows users to view and manage a list of example tasks through a browser.

The application is deployed on an Apache Tomcat application server running on an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine in Microsoft Azure. The VM is created inside a virtual network  for isolation and is reachable from the public internet over HTTP and SSH.

Key points:
- Java web app implemented using JSP/Servlets (deployed to Tomcat)
- Ubuntu Linux VM hosted on Azure (IaaS)
- VM is in a VNet and protected by a Network Security Group (NSG)
- HTTP traffic to Tomcat (port 8080) and SSH management (port 22) are allowed
- VM initial configuration is handled by a cloud-init file to minimise manual setup
